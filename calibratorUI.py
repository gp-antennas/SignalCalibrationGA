Goal:			Acts as a User Interface to all of the SignalCalibration
				code. Runs the calibratorMain.py, which in turn accesses the
				calibratorFScore.py and calibratorGA.py codes to run the
				whole program. 

Comments:		I wrote this code seperately to simplify the useage of this
				program. Most knobs to adjust the code are shown here.
